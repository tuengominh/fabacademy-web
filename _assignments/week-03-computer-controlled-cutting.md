<h2>Group Assignment</h2>
<h5>The Friday Group</h5>
<p>Our class decided to split the group based on who can come to the lab on Friday or Monday. For the Friday group, we tried to cut many pieces of different materials so each of us can go through the process once. I've worked with these below classmates during my multiple turns:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/arman-najari">Arman Naraji</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/david-prieto/">David Prieto Gonzalez</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/antoine-jaunard">Antoine Jaunard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/benjamin-scott/">Benjamin Scott</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/tue-ngo/">Minh Tue Ngo</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h5>First test with Cardboard 4mm</h5>
<p>We used this same <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:728579">test file</a> provided by the instructors to test the laser cutter <a href="https://www.troteclaser.com/es/maquinas-laser/grabadora-laser-speedy/">Trotec Speedy 100</a>. The detailed specs of the machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work area: 600 x 300mm</li>
<li>Height: 132mm</li>
<li>Laser power: 12-60W</li>
</ul>
<p>We chose to proceed with Cardboard 4mm and Plywood 4mm because we can find nice leftovers here. I've personally learned from Santi that flexible plywood is not a good material for cutting.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Material Settings</strong>, we followed the information on the Laser Cut Sample at the Fab Lab:</p>
<p>The settings we used for Cardboard 4mm:</p>
<p>Result of the first test:</p>
<p></p>
<h5>Second test with Plywood 4mm</h5>
<p>The settings we used for Plywood 4mm:</p>
<p>An enjoyable rastering and cutting process:</p>
<p>Result of the second test:</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Individual Assignment</h2>
<h5>Vinyl Cutting</h5>
<p>I used the <a href="https://www.rolanddga.com/es/soporte/products/cutting/camm-1-gx-24-24-vinyl-cutter">Roland CAMM-1 Servo GX-24</a> to cut a sticker of the logo which was designed in the <a href="http://academany.fabcloud.io/fabacademy/2020/labs/barcelona/students/tue-ngo/assignments/week-02-computer-aided-design.html">previous assignment.</a> The detailed specs of the machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work area: 584 x 24998mm</li>
<li>Width of loaded material: 50 to 700mm</li>
<li>Cutting speed: up to 500mm/s</li>
</ul>
<p>Load material</p>
<p>Adjusting the blade</p>
<p>Set origin</p>
<p></p>
<h5>Laser Cutting</h5>
<h6>OpenSCAD</h6>
<p>Parametric design is a design based on defining all the parameters, and by changing those parameteres we can quickly adjust our design.</p>
<p></p>
<h6>Tests and Final Cut</h6>
<p>I used the same Trotec Speedy 100 machine used in the group test to cut my pieces. I'm really slow and careless when it comes to machines. I kept forgetting the necessary steps, and I had to ask people "Where did he click to do this?" or "Where should I click to do that?" all the time. Big thanks to everyone!</p> 
<p>Manually focus the machine</p>
<p>Measure cuttable area and nest</p>
<p>Kerf, speed and power test</p>
<p>I need to shout out loud: <strong>Be careful with OpenSCAD!</strong> The easier it is for us to write, the easier it is for shits to happen. I mistyped something before exporting my design to DXF, and look how ridiculous things became:</p>
<p></p>
<h6>Final Result</h6>
