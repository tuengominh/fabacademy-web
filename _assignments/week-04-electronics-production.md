<h2>Understanding electronics and the boards</h2>
<p>Yes you're right, I'm that type of person who needs to understand what I'm doing before doing it. To me, electronics is a whole new world, and therefore I need to go through tutorials about basic concepts regarding electronics and circuits. Besides Oscar's classes, I followed <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit/all#overview">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<h5>Electricity and how it works</h5>
<ul>
<li>Voltage is the measurement of electrical potential produced from electricity sources, but electricity needs to flow to do anything useful.</li>
<li>Electricity needs a path to flow through, which must be an electrical conductor such as copper wire. Current is the rate at which charge is flowing. Resistance is a material's tendency to resist the flow of charge (current).</li>
<li>Electricity will flow from a higher voltage to a lower voltage. If you create a conductive path between a higher voltage and a lower voltage, electricity will flow along that path. And if you insert something useful into that path like an LED, the flowing electricity will do some work for you, like lighting up that LED.</li>
<li>There are two types of electrical signals, those being alternating current (AC), and direct current (DC). With AC, the direction electricity flows throughout the circuit is constantly reversing. With DC, electricity flows in one direction between power and ground. DC voltage sources always have two sides, with the positive side a higher voltage than the negative side.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h5>Circuit and PCB</h5>
<ul>
<li>A circuit is a circular path that starts and stops at the same place and allows electricity to flow and do something useful. Circuits is built to make electricity do something: light up, make noise, run programs, etc. A circuit should always be closed to work.</li>
<li>Things we put in the circuit that use current flow to do things are called loads, because they “load down” the power supply and slow down the current flow.</li>
<li>Short circuit is created when we connect a wire directly from the positive to the negative side of a power supply. This is bad because if there is no load to restrict the current flow, there won't be anything to slow down the current, and it will try to be infinite. This could cause the wire to burn up, damage the power supply, or drain the battery. A closely related problem is when we use the incorrect resistor value, which lets too much current flow through another component. It is very important to prevent short circuits by making sure that the positive voltage is never wired directly to ground.</li>
<li>The opposite of a short circuit is an open circuit. This is a circuit where the loop isn't fully connected. If your circuit doesn't work, the most likely cause is an open circuit. This is usually due to a broken connection or a loose wire.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h5>Series vs. Parallel: ways to wire components</h5>
<ul>
<li>Series: components are wired one after another, such that electricity has to pass through one thing, then the next thing, then the next, and so on.</li>
<li>Parallel: components are wired side by side, such that electricity passes through all of them at the same time, from one common point to another common point.</li>
</ul>
