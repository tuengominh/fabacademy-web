        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I have a constant curiosity for going deep dive into the relationship between human and machine and its subsequent implications which has led me to the questions of how new jobs will be created and what to do today to nurture the future workforce. In my opinion, intelligent systems and robots will create jobs that have never existed before and our educational system must be revamped to aid younger generations prepare for that. During my first year in Barcelona when I was studying my Master's degree, I was developing an online community-based platform helping postgraduates and life-long learners find courses and educational programs that match the requirements of future technical jobs. I would like to take on a different approach by building a tangible solution that allows people to take ownership of their own learning. In addition, I have 2 nephews, one is 6 years old and one is 4 years old. As a dedicated aunt, I've always wanted to build or develop some toys that could engage them in STEAM activities, so when they grow up they will be more than well-prepared to adapt to future jobs. That's why I'm pretty sure that my Final Project should be a modular and connected toy that can teach kids programming - the language of the future, and furthermore, give them the ability to build simple IoT devices.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h5>What will it do?</h5>
        <p>My idea is to create an off-the-screen and modular robot that can be customized in order to give preschoolers the basic ideas of programming and robotics. There will be 3 groups of blocks: <strong>Input, Logic, Output</strong>. Kids will need at least one block of each group to perform the desired task. I want the robot to symbolize a cool and modular animal, hence, I sketched here a dragon with customized powers that can be defined by kids through a trial-and-error process:</p>
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/assignments/week-01/idea-1.png" class="img-fluid w-100"/>
        <p></p>
        <p>It would be nice if there will be a <strong>mobile app</strong> connect to a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> account and execute further complicated tasks with logics inside logics. The main target users are kids 4-7 years old, however, if the mobile/tablet application is available, kids up to 12 years old are welcomed.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Who has done this before?</h5>
        <p>I found some STEAM toys (which are quite successful) with a similar idea, so I think my dragon would be useful and loved by my nephews!</p>
        <ul>

            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyya8eOCKqg">Matatalab</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our instructors Santi and Xavi also introduced some cool projects by Fab Academy's alumnus that are related to my idea:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabamsterdam/students/60/finalprojectpage.html">Self-built IoT devices from LEGO bricks</a> with the amazing idea about connecting blocks using pogo pins</li>
            <li><a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/fabacademy2017/fablabbcn/students/74/finalproject.html">DIS/ORDER modular circuit</a> for learning electronics</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h5>What makes my idea different?</h5>
        <p>This concept is not new, in fact, it has a long history with many innovative approaches. Even though, the new values I'd like to contribute are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Logic blocks: Other toys usually simplify the Input-Output relationship with a default If-Then logic. I'd like to invest further in different types of programming concepts. They could be <strong>flow controls</strong> (while, for, iteration loop) or <strong>operators</strong> (and, or, greater than, less than, equal).</li>
            <li>The Debugging process: After immersing myself into technology for a while, I realized the most important skill kids can develop is a <strong>debug</strong> mindset. My robot should be able to inform kids (or parents) whether each step is successful or there is an error at some point via a LED screen or a bar graph.</li>
            <li>An Object-Oriented approach: I'm thinking about how to resemble <strong>functions</strong> with those blocks, maybe a <strong>Call</strong> output and a <strong>Being Called</strong> input.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project development plan</h2>
        <p>I think that being hung up on sensors and actuators will both distract me from making an almost-there prototype and distract the kids from trying out as many programming concepts as possible. Hence, my MVP for Fab Academy will have <strong>2 Input blocks (including <i>Proximity</i> and <i>Being Called</i>), 3 Output blocks (including <i>Move Forward</i>, <i>Move Back</i> and <i>Call</i>), and at least 2 Logic blocks (including <i>If</i> and <i>Until</i>)</strong>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Will my Final Project incorporate what I learned?</h5>
