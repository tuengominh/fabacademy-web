    <p>I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tue-m-ngo-2b544489/">Tue M. Ngo,</a> an infinite learner from Vietnam and based in Barcelona.</p>
    <p>I graduated with multiple degrees in Design & Applied Arts, Software Development, and Digital Entrepreneurship. Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer. I often code in Java (Spring Boot), JavaScript (ReactJS, AngularJS), Ruby (Rails) and C# (.NET Core).</p>
    <p>This website is used to document my journey exploring the Fab Academy program in Fab Lab Barcelona. For more information, please refer to my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/electronics.html">Projects</a>.</p>
    <p>I aim to strengthen my ability to connect the digital and physical worlds, to create beyond the gaps, and to make impacts across various segments. I'm also leaning towards being a part of the community of anti-disciplinary social innovators, software craftsmen, digital artists, and makers. That's why I'm here!</p>
    <p>When I am offline and no one knows what Iâ€™m doing, I get to know new places and people, pursue new hobbies, and present in alternative universes.</p>
    <p>Take a look at my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects.html">Projects</a> and if you have any interesting ideas to discuss, feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:tue.ngominh@gmail.com">email</a> or message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tue-m-ngo-2b544489/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
